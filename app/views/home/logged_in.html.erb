<h2>Welcome to linguar.com!</h2>

<p>This site consists of three areas.</p>
<ul class="welcome-text">
	<li class="welcome-text">
		<%= link_to '<h2>Language exchange partner forum</h2>', tandems_path %> 
	Itâ€™s easier to learn a language with the help of a native speaker. This forum lets you easily find someone in your local area to meet up with or if you prefer a pen pal or skype pal for distance communication.
	</li>
	<li class="welcome-text">
		<%= link_to '<h2>Vocabulary drill tool</h2>', glossaries_path %> 
	You will undoubtedly learn a lot of new words from you language friend. 
	Create your own flashcard sets and enter all new expression,
	words or any things you need to remember here and use the trainer to remember them. <br />
	There are also possibilities to share your sets with other users on the
	site or even cooperate with them.</li>	
	<li class="welcome-text">
		<%= link_to '<h2>Forum for foreign languages and cultures</h2>', forums_path %>
	Having problems with the grammar, translating expressions or maybe
	something else related to the country / language? Then this is the place
	to ask others for help.</li>
</ul>
